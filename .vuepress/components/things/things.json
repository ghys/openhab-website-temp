    "description": "\nZ-Wave PIR Motion Sensor<br /><h1>Overview</h1><p>The sensor has two Association groups available for up to five Z-Wave Node IDs each.<br />Association group one is intended for but not limited to controllers. All nodes whose Node ID<br />that have been set in Association group one will receive all unsolicited Alarm Report frames,<br />and Basic Report frames of 0x00 and 0xFF. Association group two is intended for any device</p> <p>that is controllable with a Basic Set of 0xFF such as lights, sirens, or chimes.<br />When a sensor such as a door or window sensor is opened/faulted, the sensor will send a Basic<br />Report to nodes in Association group one and a Basic Set of 0xFF to Association group two.<br />When the door or window is closed the sensor will send a Basic Report of 0x00 to only group<br />one. The Configuration command class can configure the sensor to send Basic Sets of 0x00 to<br />nodes in group two (turning devices off). See Configuration Command Class.</p> <br /><h2>Wakeup Information</h2><p>By default, a sensor is configured to send Wake Up Notification frames every three hours. A<br />controller may change the duration between Wake Up Notification frames to be between one<br />hour and one week in increments of two hundred seconds with the Wake Up Interval Set<br />command. The sensor will send Wake Up Notification frames to the Node ID specified in the<br />Wake Up Set Interval command or 255 if no valid nodes have been set.</p>\n    ",

    "description": "\nZ-wave Plus Gold Plated Reliability Garage Door Tilt Sensor<br /><h2>Inclusion Information</h2><p>1. Start by placing the controller into inclusion mode.</p> <p>2. Activate inclusion mode for the sensor by inserting the battery. When the inclusion process is complete the red LED will turn on for approximately 10 seconds and then it will go out. If the LED continues to flash, repeat the inclusion process.</p> <p>3. Test the garage door sensor before mounting it. Hold the sensor in your hand. Flip the sensor upside-down and watch the LED while doing so. The LED will flash each time the position of the sensor is changed. If your Z- Wave network has a software interface you may verify that the messages from the sensor are being received each time the sensor is flipped.</p> <p>If you need to repeat the inclusion process, repeat STEP ONE above, then for STEP TWO you will need to simply remove the cover of the sensor, remove the battery for 5 seconds, reinsert the battery, and replace the sensor cover. This will re-enter the sensor in inclusion mode.</p> <br /><h2>Exclusion Information</h2><p>Exclusion mode on the sensor is activated on the sensor by the exact same procedure as inclusion.</p> <br /><h2>Wakeup Information</h2><p>To save power, this sensor sleeps most of the time and is therefore not awake to receive messages from a gateway for testing. Removing the top case from the sensor will put in device into a tampered mode in which the sensor will stay awake and able to receive messages. Most of the time an end user would not do this, but if the sensor needs to be configured after inclusion, an end user can follow the instructions below for sending Wake-Up notifications.</p> <p>The sensor will wake up every so often and when the case is closed, it will send a Wake-Up Notification to allow the life line master node controller that the sensor is now available for any queued messages that the controller may have for the sensor. <strong>The time between Wake-Up Notifications can be configured with the Wake-Up Notification command class to be between 1 hour and 1 week with interval steps of 200 seconds.</strong></p>\n    ",

The radio module uses either the smoke sensors integrated 9V battery or can be powered by an external 12V power supply.</p> <p>According to the VdS 3515 (smoke sensors with radio communication) this device will relay all alarms to all other smoke sensors (004001) in the Z-Wave network to create a house-wide alarm. This connection of the smoke sensors is fully automatical and needs no further configuration. The smoke sensors and the controller communicate via an secure protocol to prevent manipulation.</p> <h3>Prepare for Installation / Reset</h3> <p>Please read the user manual before installing the product.</p> <p>In order to include (add) a Z-Wave device to a network it <b>must be in factory default state.</b> Please make sure to reset the device into factory default. You can do this by performing an Exclusion operation as described below in the manual. Every Z-Wave controller is able to perform this operation however it is recommended to use the primary controller of the previous network to make sure the very device is excluded properly from this network.</p> <h4>Reset to factory default</h4> <p>This device also allows to be reset without any involvement of a Z-Wave controller. This procedure should only be used when the primary controller is inoperable.</p> <p>press the button on the bottom of the device for at least 10 seconds</p> <h4>Safety Warning for Batteries</h4> <p>The product contains batteries. Please remove the batteries when the device is not used. Do not mix batteries of different charging level or different brands.</p> <h3>Installation</h3> <p>Please refer to the installation guide of the smoke sensor for information about how and where the smoke sensor should be installed. The installation guide complies with the norm DIN EN 14676.</p> <ul><li>Remove the bracket from the detector main unit by rotating it counter-clockwise.</li> <li>Place the bracket where you are going to install the detector. In each of keyhole slots, draw a mark to locate plastic anchor and screw. Using a 3/16-inch (5mm) drill bit, drills two holes at the marks and insert plastic anchor, and attached the bracket by using the screws.</li> <li>Open the battery compartment (1) to activate the battery, and then close the cover.</li> <li>The optional external power supply will connect to the connector (5). The internal battery must stay inside the detector even when the external power supply is connected.</li> <li>Mount the smoke detector to the mounting ring. Make sure the hooks of the detector are placed between the hook and the twist stopper (2) of the mounting base (arrows in image above). Then turn about 15 % clockwise. (Hint. If the detector hook is not placed right between the two mounting ring structures the detector can?t be mounted to the ring).</li> </ul><p>Please follow the recommendations about amount as position of the sensor in your home as given above. Avoid to place the sensor into the angle of walls, prefer positions in the middle of the room.</p> <h3>Inclusion/Exclusion</h3> <p>On factory default the device does not belong to any Z-Wave network. The device needs to be <b>added to an existing wireless network</b> to communicate with the devices of this network. This process is called <b>Inclusion</b>.</p> <p>Devices can also be removed from a network. This process is called <b>Exclusion</b>. Both processes are initiated by the primary controller of the Z-Wave network. This controller is turned into exclusion respective inclusion mode. Inclusion and Exclusion is then performed doing a special manual action right on the device.</p> <h4>Inclusion</h4> <p>A single click on the button (3) includes the device. If the button is pressed for at least 2 seconds the inclusion will be done without the (<em>Security Command Class </em>). </p> <h4>Exclusion</h4> <p>A single click on the button will exclude the device.</p> <h3>Product Usage</h3> <p>In case smoke is detected by the smoke detector the device will sound, the red LED will blink and the wireless module will issue a Z-Wave alarm command to the main controller and other associated devices. A low battery will be indicated on short siren noise plus the Z-Wave controller will be informed using Battery Low warning commands.</p> <p><em>Note: All communication of the wireless module is performed with application level security if the device was included securely and all communication partners support secure communication as well. In case a non-secure device is associated for switching on smoke alarm, the smoke detector will detect this and change its communication styla with this very device to non-secure. This process happens one time and will take about 20 seconds. This delay will happen on first communication only.</em></p> <p>The siren can be used for other alarm indication. For this reason the device will be shown at Graphical user interface as a simple on/off switch. Turning on this switch start the siren, turning it off will stop the noise. The generic siren alarm has a different acoustic pattern than the permanent sound caused by smoke. The configuration parameters 1 and 2 define the style of the sound.</p> <p><strong>Automatic radio meshing of the smoke sensor</strong></p> <p>Thanks to Z-Wave the smoke sensor can communicate fully automatic. In case of an alarm (smoke or battery) the device will send a notification to all other smoke sensors in the network. The receiving smoke sensor transmit the alarm to other smoke sensors until all smoke sensors have received the alarm.</p> <p>It is possible to wirelessly turn off the siren on all repeating smoke detectors but not on the detector that originally sent the alarm. You must find and remove the reason for the smoke detector to buzz.<br /><br /><strong>Please note that this meshing is not recommended for networks with more than 3 smoke detectors. In this case please control theme using a central controller and turn off the meshing function by setting configuration parameter 5 and 6.</strong></p> <h3>Node Information Frame</h3> <p>The Node Information Frame (NIF) is the business card of a Z-Wave device. It contains information about the device type and the technical capabilities. The inclusion and exclusion of the device is confirmed by sending out a Node Information Frame. Beside this it may be needed for certain network operations to send out a Node Information Frame. To issue a NIF execute the following action:</p> <p>A simple click on the button (3) sends a NIF.</p> <h3>Quick trouble shooting</h3> <p>Here are a few hints for network installation if things dont work as expected.</p> <ol><li>Make sure a device is in factory reset state before including. In doubt exclude before include.</li> <li>If inclusion still fails, check if both devices use the same frequency.</li> <li>Remove all dead devices from associations. Otherwise you will see severe delays.</li> <li>Never use sleeping battery devices without a central controller.</li> <li>Dont poll FLIRS devices.</li> <li>Make sure to have enough mains powered device to benefit from the meshing</li> </ol><h3>Association - one device controls an other device</h3> <p>Z-Wave devices control other Z-Wave devices. The relationship between one device controlling another device is called association. In order to control a different device, the controlling device needs to maintain a list of devices that will receive controlling commands. These lists are called association groups and they are always related to certain events (e.g. button pressed, sensor triggers, ...). In case the event happens all devices stored in the respective association group will receive the same wireless command wireless command, typically a 'Basic Set' Command.</p> <h4>Association Groups:</h4> <p>Group Number: 1, Maximum Nodes: 4, Description: Lifeline</p> <p>Group Number: 2, Maximum Nodes: 4, Description: Alarm Reports</p> <p>Group Number: 3, Maximum Nodes: 4, Description: Switching Command when Alarm</p> <h3>Configuration Parameters</h3> <p>Z-Wave products are supposed to work out of the box after inclusion, however certain configuration can adapt the function better to user needs or unlock further enhanced features.</p> <p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Controllers may only allow configuring signed values. In order to set values in the range 128...255 the value sent in the application shall be the desired value minus 256. For example: To set a parameter to 200 it may be needed to set a value of 200 minus 256 = minus 56. In case of a two byte value the same logic applies: Values greater than 32768 may needed to be given as negative values too.</p> <h4>Parameter 1: Siren alarm sequence interval</h4> <p><i>The additional siren is creating a different acoustic signal differentiate from the smoke alarm.

The device needs to be <b>added to an existing wireless network</b> to communicate with the devices of this network. This process is called <b>Inclusion</b>.</p> <p>Devices can also be removed from a network. This process is called <b>Exclusion</b>. Both processes are initiated by the primary controller of the Z-Wave network. This controller is turned into exclusion respective inclusion mode. Inclusion and Exclusion is then performed doing a special manual action right on the device.</p> <h4>Inclusion</h4> <p>Blinking red/green LED indicates that the device is in factory reset state. Once the controller is turned into inclusion mode <strong>triple click of the buttons on the device will include the device</strong>. A green blinking of the LED will indicate successful inclusion that will be turned off shortly afterwards. The <strong>device is excluded by triple click to one of the buttons</strong> when the controller is in exclusion mode.</p> <h4>Exclusion</h4> <p>Blinking red/green LED indicates that the device is in factory reset state. Once the controller is turned into inclusion mode <strong>triple click of the buttons on the device will include the device</strong>. A green blinking of the LED will indicate successful inclusion that will be turned off shortly afterwards. The <strong>device is excluded by triple click to one of the buttons</strong> when the controller is in exclusion mode.</p> <h3>Product Usage</h3> <p>The actuator is operated by the local switching paddles or wirelessly using Z-Wave commands (communication patterns 1, 4, 5 and 7). If the insert is mounted correctly pushing the upper part of the paddle will turn on the load; pushing the lower part of the paddle will turn off the electric load.</p> <p>The device is also able to report status changes to a controller (communication pattern 2) and to remotely operate other devices (communication pattern 5) by sending wireless Z-Wave commands. In case the remote device is a switch as well the remote operation is similar to the local operation by pushing upper to lower part of the switching paddle. However the device can also be configured with configuration parameter <strong>13</strong> and <strong>14</strong> to operate remote dimmers. To dim a remote device the paddle needs to be pushed and hold (upper part to dim up, lower part to dim down). Its furthermore possible to assign remote operation functions to the double click of the paddles.</p> <p>Configuration parameter <strong>2</strong> enables a special function of the device. Its possible to define a timeout to automatically turn off the device after it was turned on manually.</p> <h3>Quick trouble shooting</h3> <p>Here are a few hints for network installation if things dont work as expected.</p> <ol><li>Make sure a device is in factory reset state before including. In doubt exclude before include.</li> <li>If inclusion still fails, check if both devices use the same frequency.</li> <li>Remove all dead devices from associations. Otherwise you will see severe delays.</li> <li>Never use sleeping battery devices without a central controller.</li> <li>Dont poll FLIRS devices.</li> <li>Make sure to have enough mains powered device to benefit from the meshing</li> </ol><h3>Configuration Parameters</h3> <p>Z-Wave products are supposed to work out of the box after inclusion, however certain configuration can adapt the function better to user needs or unlock further enhanced features.</p> <p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Controllers may only allow configuring signed values. In order to set values in the range 128 ... 255 the value sent in the application shall be the desired value minus 256. For example: To set a parameter to 200 it may be needed to set a value of 200 minus 256 = minus 56. In case of a two byte value the same logic applies: Values greater than 32768 may needed to be given as negative values too.</p> <br /><h2>Inclusion Information</h2><p>If the controller is in inclusion mode, press one of the buttons three times</p> <br /><h2>Exclusion Information</h2><p>If the controller is in exclusion mode, press one of the buttons three times</p>\n    ",

Drip and Comfort join Strips Guard, the thinnest magnet sensor in the world detecting if your windows are open and closed invisibly since 2015. Strip Drip sends an alarm signal if it detects a water leak. Its unique design allows it to be easily placed almost everywhere, including most places other sensors simply can’t fit. With soaking pads integrated in the mounting plate even small amounts of water will be detected. The built-in temperature sensor gives the possibility to combine the leakage alarm with a freeze alarm. There is also a built-in ambient light sensor that may be useful in special applications. Strips Comfort is a very accurate temperature and ambient light sensor. The unique design and mounting plate makes it easy to place almost invisibly in your home to measure temperature or control heating, air conditioning and even windows blinds which are connected to your Z-Wave smart home system. All Strips products can be used both in-doors and out-doors and the integrated custom battery gives Strips an expected lifetime of up to 10 years. For you, this means no hassle needing to change or charge batteries in your Strips sensors for the lifetime of the products!</p> <p>You may need to reset Strips if your Z-Wave controller is missing or not responding. Follow the instructions for “Wake up”, but on the 3rd repetition, leave the magnet at the rounded edge for 10 seconds.

    "description": "\nRemotely Controlled Ventilation<br /><h1>Overview</h1><p><strong>NB</strong>, theese are excerpts from the official manual found here: https://www.systemair.com/globalassets/documentation/64581.pdf</p> <p><strong>Also note</strong> that the adapter works by sitting on top of the Modbus adapter in your ventilation unit. All commands talk to the Modbus adapter, if you are in doubt about a command check out the modbus documentation from Systemair here: http://catalogue2.systemair.com/FileHandler.axd?id=67600</p> <p>The Systemair Z-Wave Ventilation is a residential heat recovery ventilation system, which consists of the following main modules:</p> <ul><li>Ventilation Unit, which is controlled by a module called PCU-ECx, where ‘x’ is a digit representing the module generation.</li> <li>One or more local User Interface/s called CDx, where ‘x’ is a digit representing the module generation. The CDx is connected to the PCU-ECx. Via CDx the user can control locally the Ventilation Unit.</li> <li>Z-Wave to Systemair HVAC Interface Adapter, which connects the Z-Wave network with the Ventilation Unit.</li> </ul><p><strong>Application status </strong></p> <p>Some of the implemented CCs need to be translated to the Ventilation Unit via the Modbus interface. Due to some reasons that communication couldn’t be available, for example – disconnected/damaged communication cable. In order to cover such situations, the Application Status Command Class has been implemented. So, In case of no communication between Z-Wave Adapter and the Ventilation Unit Module, the Device will send “Application Reject Request” for all Z-Wave commands required communication with the Ventilation Unit. If the Modbus communication is up and running, the device is always available to respond in the specified time, i.e. the device will never report “Application Busy” command.</p> <p><strong>Associations</strong></p> <p>The Device supports one, the Lifeline Association Group only. Maximum 5 nodes can be added to that group. The device uses the Lifeline group to send the following unsolicited reports:</p> <p>• Thermostat Mode Report – when thermostat mode changes, <br />• Thermostat Setpoint Report – when the temperature setpoint changes, <br />• Thermostat Fan Mode Report – when the fan level changes, <br />• Notification Report – when an alarm occurs, <br />• Switch Binary Report – when the device enter/exit the Boost mode, <br />• Device Reset Locally – at factory reset</p> <p><strong>Temperature setpoint</strong></p> <p>The device supports “Thermostat Auto changeover” setpoint type only. The setpoint range varies in depend of the ventilation system type (Table 3) and some other ventilation unit configurations. All of these dependencies must be fixed at inclusion time, so the system will be fully defined. The Host shall retrieve the setpoint range using the Thermostat Setpoint Capabilities Get V3 command. In additional to the reported Min and Max Values, 0°C is supported as well. The device accepts the setpoints in a predefined step in the reported range. It is available via the Configuration CC, parameter 5 (see Table 2: Configuration Parameters).</p> <p>See documentation link for tables: https://www.systemair.com/globalassets/documentation/64581.pdf</p> <p><strong>Fan mode</strong></p> <p>The device will support Fan Auto Mode, if both RH and CO2 senors are present. This must be done at inclusion time. The Z-Wave Systemair Ventilation supports following Thermostat Fan Modes:</p> <p>See documentation link for tables: https://www.systemair.com/globalassets/documentation/64581.pdf</p> <p><strong>Boost Mode </strong></p> <p>The Systemair Z-Wave Ventilation has implemented a Boost Mode. That mode overrides the selected fan speed, setting it to a predefined level (usually high) for a predefined time period. To set the Boost Mode remotely via Z-Wave, the Binary Switch CC is used. But that binary switch is a bit special – Once it is turned ON, it locks itself in ON position for the predefined time period, and it can’t be turned off until that time period expires. The Host can use the Ventilation System Boost mode in case of smoke or fire alarm for example.</p> <p><strong>Alarms</strong></p> <p>The implemented Notification CC V3 is used to report the device malfunctions:</p> <p>• Notification Type 0x09 – “System” <br />• Event Type 0x03 – “System Hardware Failure with manufacture proprietary code”</p> <p>The failures are reported in a two bytes value, where each bit represents a certain alarm. If the bit is set (1) the alarm is active, and if the bit is cleared (0) the alarm is not active.</p> <p>Any bit’s transition from 0 to 1 will trigger an unsolicited Notification Report. The system maintains a repeat timeout counter for each alarm, which is hard coded to 24 hours. So, an alarm occurrence runs its counter. When the repeat time expires and the alarm still exists (its bit is set) a new unsolicited Notification Report will be send. A bit’s transition from 1 to 0 clears its repeat counter. The alarms are generated in the Ventilation Unit.</p> <p>See documentation link for alarm details: https://www.systemair.com/globalassets/documentation/64581.pdf</p> <br /><h2>Inclusion Information</h2><p>When the device is not added to a Z-Wave network, then triple short clicks of the inclusion button will start the inclusion. The device begins a classic inclusion. If after 3 attempts the inclusion doesn’t succeed, then the Network Wide Inclusion will be started.</p> <br /><h2>Exclusion Information</h2><p>When the device is already included in a Z-Wave network, then triple short clicks of the inclusion button will exclude it from that Z-Wave network.</p>\n    ",

Similarly to the other WiDom “in wall” devices, it can be fully integrated into pre-existing systems and configured to associate configurable behaviours to a specific number of clicks, in full integration with the Z-Wave home automation ecosystem.</p> <p>Each of its two channels features an integrated consumption measurement device. The Universal Double Switch also boasts the lowest energy consumption on the market.</p> <p>At the same time, it is completely configurable so that it can adapt to the most varied needs while also being ready to be used without needing additional configurations in order to operate.</p> <p>Thanks to the framework developed by WiDom, the various types of “events” on the “External Switch” can be recognised and associated to actions to be performed on the device, on any associated devices, on all devices on the network. The events that the system recognises are the number of “clicks” or hold on the External Switch.</p> <p><br />External switch: External button or switch connected to the input I1 or I2</p> <p>Events: The actions performed on the external Switch: Clicks or Hold.</p> <p>Click: If the external switch is a button (when pressed it autonomously returns to the initial position), a click means pressing and then releasing it. If the external switch is bistable (when pressed it does not return to the initial position), a single click means one single flip of the switch.</p> <p>Technical Specifications</p> <p>Power Supply: 230 VAC±10% 50/60 Hz<br />Maximum Load on Relay Resistive Loads: 8 A for each channel; 10A for both channels<br />Limit Temperature: 105 °C<br />Work Temperature: -10 – 40 °C<br />Radio Protocol Z-Wave: 868,4 MHz<br />Radio Range: Up to 100 m outdoor, Up to 40 m indoor<br />Dimensions (WxDxH): 37x37x17 mm<br />Consumption: &lt; 260 mW in standby; &lt; 480 mW with one working load; &lt; 700 mW with both working loads<br />Electrical IP Rating: IP 20<br />Actuator element: Relay<br />Conformity: CE, RoHS</p> <br /><h2>Inclusion Information</h2><p>The device supports both the Network Wide Inclusion (which offers the opportunity of inclusion into a network even if the device is not directly connected to the controller) and the Normal Inclusion mechanisms.</p> <p>If the device is not included into a Z-Wave network, a single click on the (B) button or on one of the external switches will launch the process of traditional inclusion. If the device inclusion procedure does not start within 2 seconds, the Network Wide Inclusion network will be launched lasting a variable amount of time between 15-30 seconds.</p> <p>INFO: Through the inclusion procedure, activated with a single click on one of the external switches, the system determines the type of external switch (see parameter No. 62).</p> <br /><h2>Exclusion Information</h2><p>Only a controller can remove a device from the network. WiDom Universal Double Switch is compatible with all Z-Wave certified controllers. After the exclusion procedure has been activated by the controller, the device can be removed, putting it in Exclusion Mode by three consecutive clicks on the (B) button or on the external switch, when available.</p>\n    ",
